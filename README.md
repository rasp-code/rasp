## Who am I ? 🤷🏻‍♂️

Ambroise Durst, a third-year IT student from [EPITA](https://www.epita.fr).

Not specialized yet, I'm genuinely interested in all areas of computer science, though I'd love to dive deeper into research, AI, or anything pure science related.

You can check my projects, many of them were team-based ❤️
